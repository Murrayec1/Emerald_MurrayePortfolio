# How to Deploy Your ePortfolio

## Option 1: View Locally
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser
3. The portfolio will work fully offline

## Option 2: Deploy to GitHub Pages (Recommended for Sharing)

### Steps to Enable GitHub Pages:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/Murrayec1/Emerald_MurrayePortfolio
2. Click on **Settings** (top menu)
3. Scroll down to the **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select the branch you want to deploy (e.g., `main` or your current branch)
5. Select the root folder `/` as the source
6. Click **Save**
7. Wait a few minutes for GitHub to build and deploy your site
8. Your portfolio will be available at: `https://murrayec1.github.io/Emerald_MurrayePortfolio/`

### Submitting Your Portfolio Link
Once GitHub Pages is enabled, you can submit the following link for your class assignment:

**Portfolio URL:** `https://murrayec1.github.io/Emerald_MurrayePortfolio/`

## Option 3: View on GitHub
You can also view the HTML file directly on GitHub by clicking on `index.html` in the repository, though this won't show the full interactive experience.

## Troubleshooting
- If the site doesn't work immediately, wait 5-10 minutes after enabling GitHub Pages
- Make sure the branch you selected in GitHub Pages settings has your latest changes
- Verify that `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` are all in the root directory

## Making Updates
After making any changes to your portfolio:
1. Commit and push your changes to GitHub
2. GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild your site within a few minutes
3. Clear your browser cache if you don't see the changes immediately
