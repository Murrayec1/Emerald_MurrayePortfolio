            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Emerald Murray. This ePortfolio demonstrates my work and growth throughout UCO 2200: Foundations of Professional Studies.</p>
            <p>UCO 2200 is a course designed to orient Professional Studies students in their academic and career paths. In this introductory class, we'll explore various resources and support (academic, personal, social, etc.) in order to prepare you for the Professional Studies program including appropriate minors. In addition, the course will help you develop and fine-tune your career readiness skills.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Academic resources and support</li>
                <li>Personal and social development</li>
                <li>Career readiness skills</li>

                <h3>Key Learning: The Power of a Master Resume</h3>
                <p>One of the most valuable lessons from UCO 2200 was understanding the importance of maintaining a <strong>Master Resume</strong>. This comprehensive document serves as a repository of all my experiences, skills, and accomplishments. From this master version, I can strategically craft targeted, concise resumes tailored to specific positions—highlighting only the most relevant qualifications for each opportunity.</p>
                <p>This approach has transformed how I present myself professionally, ensuring that each application directly addresses the employer's needs while maintaining authenticity and focus.</p>

                <h3>The Power of Professional Networking</h3>
                <p>Another critical insight from UCO 2200 was discovering the importance of <strong>professional networking</strong> and actively building connections through platforms like <strong>Handshake</strong> and <strong>LinkedIn</strong>. These platforms serve different but complementary purposes in career development:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Handshake</strong> connects students directly with employers seeking entry-level and campus talent, offering internships, part-time positions, and career fairs tailored to university students.</li>
                    <li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> provides a broader professional network for long-term career growth, allowing connections with industry professionals, alumni, and recruiters across all career stages.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By actively engaging on both platforms, I've expanded my professional visibility and created meaningful connections that support my career goals. Networking isn't just about finding jobs—it's about building relationships, learning from others' experiences, and staying informed about industry trends.</p>

                <h3>Featured Poem: Scars of Treblinka</h3>
                <p><em>Written during my visit to Germany as part of the Jewish Federation of Greensboro educational grant program</em></p>
                
                <div class="poem">
                    <p>
                        In Treblinka's hush, the earth remembers—<br>
                        Each stone a name, each boulder a prayer,<br>
                        Sixteen thousand souls in a day's brief passage,<br>
                        Now held by silence, willow, and air.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The willow stands, a trembling sentinel,<br>
                        Its leaves whispering what words can't bear.<br>
                        Around it—fields sown with heartbreak,<br>
                        And stones that speak of loss everywhere.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The Nazis, in vain, planted trees for disguise,<br>
                        Roots forced to cover the sins of the land;<br>
                        But the soil, refusing to be silenced,<br>
                        Bared its wounds—truth none could withstand.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Time's passage brought seekers and diggers,<br>
                        Unearthing the artifacts of pain:<br>
                        Buttons, shoes, and fragments of letters—<br>
                        Echoes of lives, cut short, remain.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        There is a strangeness in the forest's hush,<br>
                        Where trees seem stained with a sorrowful hue,<br>
                        Their bark tinted red, like the memory of blood,<br>
                        Twisted in shape by what they once knew.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Here, the wind carries more than autumn's chill,<br>
                        It hums with grief, with stories untold,<br>
                        And the earth, though scarred, will not let us forget<br>
                        The innocence buried beneath its cold.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        So stand in the shadow of willow and stone,<br>
                        Listen—nature itself will confide:<br>
                        In the heart of Treblinka, the world can still hear<br>
                        The cries of the lost, who never truly died.
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <p class="poem-context">This poem was born from my deeply moving experience visiting Treblinka during my educational journey through Europe. Standing in that sacred space, I felt compelled to honor the memory of those lost and to give voice to the profound weight of history that the land still carries. UCO 2200 gave me the confidence to share these important reflections with the world.</p>
