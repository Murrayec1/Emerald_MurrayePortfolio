            <p>UC 2200 is a course designed to orient Professional Studies students in their academic and career paths. In this introductory class, we'll explore various resources and support (academic, personal, social, etc.) in order to prepare you for the Professional Studies program including appropriate minors. In addition, the course will help you develop and fine-tune your career readiness skills.</p>
